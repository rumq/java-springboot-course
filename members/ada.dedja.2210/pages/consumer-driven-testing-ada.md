Consumer-driven Contract Testing (or CDC for short) is a software testing methodology used to test components of a system in isolation while ensuring that 
provider components are compatible with the expectations that consumer components have of them.


Pact is a code-first consumer-driven contract testing tool, and is generally used by developers and testers who code. The contract is generated during 
the execution of the automated consumer tests.
