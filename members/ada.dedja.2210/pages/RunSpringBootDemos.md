I tried to run the application in VS code, but it was taking very long more than 5 min to run and then I opened the first demo Demo02SimpleAppApplication
It ran successfully.

I ran demo.restservices (Demo-11) and it ran successfully on port 8080 (http://localhost:8080/simple/productsV1)
It will show an xml list of products because based on PPT 11 the JSON/XML serializers will convert Product objects to/from JSON or XML automatically, as appropriate.

Demos from 1-5 were successfully ran during and after respective Spring Boot Classes
