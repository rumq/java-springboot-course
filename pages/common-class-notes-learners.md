**Chapter 1**

Setting IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate edition because the community edition does not support spring boot 
We can use free trial for that which is for 30 days

Most of the companies are using IntelliJ, Eclipse is also a good option to use too.

To create a new project for spring boot there is also a website Spring initializr  https://start.spring.io/

You can choose 
Project : Maven
Language: Java
Spring boot: 2.7.5 
Project Metadata : Fill in the fields.


**Chapter 2**

Create a simple app using IntelliJ
Yellow -java code
Blue- configurations

IntelliJ Java dependencies that we should have installed 
- JDK (e.g. JDK 11)
- Set JAVA_HOME to the JDK folder
- PATH to include the JDK binary folder


Create a new project 
- Enter a suitable name
- Location 
- Language: Java
- Type: Maven
- Group id : the name of the company
- artifact id: is the name of the jar file
- Package name
- Project SDK: is the JDK version (version 11)
- Always choose the jar option - so it can be a complete a stand alone project


In intelliJ there is a Spring Initializr that we can use to create our project.

Aplication Structure
Maven project with a pom.xml file with the information of your project.


Exercise - create the basic spring app using the spring initilizer website
